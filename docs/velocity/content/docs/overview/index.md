# Why Velocity CI?

* Reproducible builds through GitOps
* Lightweight
* Docker focused
* Task runner

Velocity CI aims to provide robust Continuous Integration/Deployment as a task runner. 

In a nutshell, you define *[Tasks](/docs/overview/tasks/)* in your repository, which you can then run via the Velocity CLI or on Velocity CI. ~~These can be automatically ran on push via the `.velocity.yaml` file~~ **TODO**.
